The text is about someone starting their Master's in Biology, struggling with living expenses from a stipend of $28,500, working part-time as a lab technician, dealing with seasonal affective disorder, being 24 years old, Ethiopian, into vintage vinyl and astrophotography, and spending weekends away from city lights.\n\nNow, I need to identify all PII here. Let's go step by step.\n\n1. \"Master's in Biology\" – This seems like an education level, so type \"education\". Relevance to the question about managing costs: maybe low, since the question is about financial management, but the education is part of their situation. Wait, the question is about managing living costs as a graduate student. The education might be relevant in terms of their status, but the stipend is mentioned. So maybe the education is part of their context but not directly relevant to the question. Hmm.\n\n2. \"stipend $28,", "generated_text": "", "parsed": null}
